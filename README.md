This are the scripts that I use for competition purposes when blue teaming. Hi red team. 

## Wishlist
### More network traffic analysis 
 - Beacon Detection
 - Common IPs
 - Where users are logging in from
 - Port Used? Outgoing traffic?

### User Login Activity 
 - Notify of each login clean
    - List IP, User, Time
 - SSH key or password, and where SSH key located
 - Wall notify when user logs in

### Better Web Knowledge ##
 - Apparmor?
 - Look for PHP shells
 - Log all Web Requests


### SNOOPY OP

 - Snoopy Parser????
